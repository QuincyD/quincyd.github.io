			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
            I recieved a B.S.E. from the University of Michigan in April 2017 with a major in computer science and a minor in mathematics. I enjoy studying many subjects, on my own, too, and have embraced my curious nature wholeheartedly. I'm currently focusing on various topics relating to computer science, as well as, economics and business, and spanish fluency.

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p>I'm currently working with the Language and Information Technologies group at U. of M.'s College of Engineering. I've helped with data collection and processing for a project researching age and gender deception detection on online communities and I'm currently assisting with another research project that is utilizing computational linguistics to assist with collecting pedigrees in the medical field.

			I've done many projects for my degree as well. Within my last year of school, for example, I've worked with a team that has created an online photo album using django along with python and ajax along with javascript. I've also worked with a team that crawled stack overflow to recreate its automatic post tagging by classifying posts from analyzing the language and syntax from both the posts and the top response(s). Finally, I worked with a team to classify sentiment of messages within conversations using, not only the message, but also the language and sentiment of the messages surrounding the message within the conversation.</p>
