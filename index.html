<h2>Past Projects</h2>

<p>

While working as part of the <em>Language and Information Technologies (LIT)</em> research group, I helped on research to use NLP to attain pedigrees from cancer patients. <strong>My primary tasks involved verifying/pre-processing data from Amazon Mechanical Turk and then creating a model that predicted the names, genders and ages of family members presented in the surveys.</strong> 

<br><br>

Another project at <em>LIT</em> involved helping produce an accepted paper into the <em>International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP) 2017</em> titled <em>Identity Deception Detection by Ver&oacute;nica P&eacute;rez-Rosas, Quincy Davenport, Anna Dai, Mohamed Abouelenien, and Rada Mihalcea.</em> <strong>My primary task was simply verifying and pre-processing data.</strong>

<br><br>

Another notable project while studying at the <em>University of Michigan</em> involved a group and I researching and creating a prediction system that completed a task given by a previous <em>Stack Overflow</em> competition for predicting a new post's tags. <strong>I primarily worked on creating a Naive Bayes tag predictor with Python.</strong>

<br><br> 

A final past project I want to note was during a web development class. In a group of 3, we designed a website for online photo albums. <strong>We all were able to work equally on both front-end and back-end using JS, HTML, and CSS along with Python's Django framework and MySQL.</strong>

<h2>Current Projects</h2>
<p>
I'm currently working on two personal projects. The first has been a way to accomplish two tasks: learn PHP and assist my group of friends with event planning. The repository is private for this project, but below is a sample of my work.

<p>
The other project is a recent one. I'm interested in the NBA and I, along with others, have a certain concern with it. Below is an image, but I encourage you to check out my 'standings' repository for more details. Right now, I have only needed Javascript, HTML, and CSS for the task.
