			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p>Recently, I worked with the Language and Information Technologies group at the University of Michigan's College of Engineering. Primarily, I assisted with a research project utilizing computational linguistics to assist with collecting pedigrees in the medical field.

            <br><br>I've also helped with data collection and processing for a project researching age and gender deception detection on online communities. The work and results have been accepted into the International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP) 2017 in a paper titled Identity Deception Detection by Ver&oacute;nica P&eacute;rez, Quincy Davenport, Anna Dai, Mohamed Abouelenien, and Rada Mihalcea.

			I've done many projects for my degree from U. of M., as well. Within my last year of school, for example, I've worked with a team that has created an online photo album using Python and MySQL for backend and Javascript for frontend. I've also worked with a team that crawled stack overflow to recreate its automatic post tagging by training classifiers on the language and syntax from both the posts and the top response(s). Finally, I worked with a team to classify sentiment of messages within conversations using, not only the message, but also the language and sentiment of the other messages surrounding the message within the conversation.</p>
