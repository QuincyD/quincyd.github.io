			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I recieved a B.S.E. from the University of Michigan in April 2017 with a major in computer science and a minor in mathematics. I enjoy studying many subjects and have embraced my curious nature wholeheartedly. I'm currently focusing on various topics relating to computer science, as well as, economics and business, and spanish fluency.</p>

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p>I'm currently working with the Language and Information Technologies group at U. of M.'s College of Engineering. I've helped with data collection for a project researching age and gender deception detection on online communities and I'm currently assisting with another research project that is utilizing computational linguistics to assist in the medical field.

			<br><br>

			I've done many projects for my degree as well. Within my last year of school, for example, I've worked with a team that has created an online photo album via django on python and ajax with javascript. I've also worked with a team that crawled stack overflow to recreate its automatic post tagging by classifying posts by analyzing the language and syntax from both the posts and the top response(s). Finally, I worked with a team to classify sentiment of messages within conversations using, not only the message, but also the language and sentiment of the messages surrounding the message in the conversation.</p>
