<h2>Academics</h2>

I graduated Cum Laude with a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Engineering</strong> from the <em>University of Michigan's College of Engineering</em> in April 2017 with a major in computer science and a minor in mathematics. I also participated in research with the <em>Language and Information Technologies (LIT)</em> research group and the <em>Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering (SURE)</em> program.

<h2>Personal Mission Statement</h2>


My mission is to strive for excellence in all areas of life, completing my path from dependence to independence and ultimately from independence to interdependence.

<br><br>

I will be an open, faithful, and loving partner. Whether it is discussing decisions, spending quality time, or simply listening, I will always provide love and support all throughout my relationship.

<br><br>

I will be a compassionate son, brother, uncle and friend, giving a helping hand when needed or just being present to continually nurture my relationships with those close to me.

<br><br>

I will be a diligent co-worker and employee, consistently leading by example, if nothing else, as well as, staying informed in my field to provide high quality work and performance.

<br><br>

I will respect my fellow man and seek first to understand in every encounter, continuously promoting growth and development in our shared journey toward a better world.

<br><br>

I will work to become healthier physically, savvier financially, wiser mentally and more in control emotionally.

<br><br>

I will remain curious and honest in my quest to be a better man, while building better habits to ensure that I learn from every situation, display decisiveness, and utilize my resources superlatively.

<br><br>

<strong><em>I will continually listen, think, and enjoy life.</em></strong>
